i)When gamma value is very less the accuracy of the model is very less and it is almost constant.</br>
ii)When gamma value is from 0.00001 to 0.001 the accuracy of the model is increasing from 86.11% to 97.03%</br>
iii)When gamma value is from 0.01 to 10000 the accuracy of the model is decreasing and then it remains constant.</br>
iv)The accuracy of the model first remains constant for lesser values of gamma and then increases and then again decreases for higher values of gamma.</br>
v)It is behaving like a bell shaped curve.</br>
